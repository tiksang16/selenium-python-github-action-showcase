# Selenium-Python CI/CD Showcase

This repository is designed to demonstrate automated testing using **Selenium** with **Python** and an integrated workflow for deploying test sites and reports. It includes the following:

1. A test site hosted on **AWS S3**: [Test Site](http://selenium-python-resolver.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/)
2. Automated Selenium tests that generate an **Allure Report**.
3. **GitHub Actions** workflows to:
   - Automatically deploy the test site to AWS S3 when changes are made.
   - Run Selenium tests, generate an Allure Report, and deploy the report to AWS S3: [Allure Report](https://allure-report-resolver.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html).

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before running the tests and viewing the Allure report locally, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.7 or higher**

2. **Pip (Python Package Manager)**  

3. **Allure Command-Line Tool**  
   - Install Allure ([Installation Guide](https://allurereport.org/docs/install/)).

## **Workflow Overview**

### **1. Local Testing Workflow**
Users can clone the repository and run Selenium tests locally using Python. The steps include:
- Setting up a Python virtual environment.
- Installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Running the Selenium tests.
- Viewing the test report generated by Allure.

### **2. Automated Deployment and Testing Workflow**
This repository includes two GitHub Actions workflows:
1. **`deploy-s3.yml`: Deploys the test site's HTML file (`QE-index.html`) to AWS S3 when changes are pushed to the repository.**
   - Trigger: Push to `resources/QE-index.html`.
   - Deploys the test site to [Test Site URL](http://selenium-python-resolver.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/).

2. **`selenium-tests.yml`: Runs the Selenium tests, generates an Allure Report, and deploys it to AWS S3.**
   - Trigger: Push to the `main` branch or manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`.
   - Deploys the Allure report to [Allure Report URL](https://allure-report-resolver.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## **Technologies Used**

### **Programming Languages**
- **Python**: For writing Selenium test scripts and managing dependencies.

### **Testing Frameworks and Tools**
- **Selenium**: For automating browser interactions.
- **Pytest**: For organizing and running test cases.
- **Allure**: For generating detailed and interactive test reports.

### **Cloud Services**
- **AWS S3**: For hosting the test site and Allure reports.

### **CI/CD**
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating deployment and testing pipelines.

## How to Trigger Tests Manually on GitHub Actions

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in the GitHub repository.
2. Select the **Run Selenium Tests and Deploy Allure Report** workflow.
3. Click on **Run workflow** and follow the instructions.

#### **Once the pipeline completes:**
- Test results will be available in - [Allure Report URL](https://allure-report-resolver.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html)

---

## **How to Run the Tests Locally**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### **2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment**
Create and activate a virtual environment:

#### On Linux/MacOS
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Run the Selenium Tests**
Run the Selenium tests using Pytest. This will execute the test cases and generate the test results in a directory that can later be used to create an Allure Report:

```bash
pytest --alluredir=reports
```

### **5. View the Allure Report**

```bash
allure serve reports
```
